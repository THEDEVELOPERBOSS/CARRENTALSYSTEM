# CARRENTALSYSTEM
this will be a way for you to enter what car you want to rent and then you enter a number corrosponding to the car. I will also make it so you can add at least 3 more cars of your choice if you are an admin.(that feature may come later)At the beginning it will ask you if you are an admin or a user. If you are an admin it will ask you for a password. You can help me with this project if you would like. Download the file and use something like vs code or geany to help. I am just a beginner so anything helps.
